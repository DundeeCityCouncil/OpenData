# Bin and Recycling Container Schedules

Dundee City City Council continues to introduce [kerbside recycling on a phased approach](http://www.dundeecity.gov.uk/recyclefordundee/). 

Our database for managing bins and routes does not yet hold the full details of the schedules at a household level as this is managed through a separate process.

We provide a [calendar lookup page](https://www.dundeecity.gov.uk/forms/wastemgt_calendars.php?_qf_page2_display=true)  for members of the public to lookup their property, and download a PDF calendar showing their scheduled collections.  

The data used on the [calendar lookup page](https://www.dundeecity.gov.uk/forms/wastemgt_calendars.php?_qf_page2_display=true) contains for each household:

* UPRN (Unique Property Reference Number) for the Property
* Bin & Waste Type
* Collection Frequency
* Route
* _Day_ of Collection
* Calendar file name (if required).

The linked Calendar files are available for download from https://www.dundeecity.gov.uk/forms/AdobeDocs/.

The calendars are generated from the schedule csv's on a batch process. The design of the schedule files has been updated for each phase of the re-organisation and don't follow a standard schema.

## Licensing 
This schedule and bin information is Â© Dundee City Council and available for re-use under an [Open Government Licence](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).  The calendar PDF documents are not currently licenced for re-use.

For further information on the address gazetteer and to find the UPRN of your property please visit the [One Scotland Gazetteer](http://www.onescotlandgazetteer.org.uk/).

## Future Plans
For the 2018 calendar year we plan to re-organise the way this information is stored and schedules are managed. Once completed this data will be published to the Council's open data platform for re-use.

We are open to suggestions on how the schedule information should be published to enable re-use by others.  If you are interested in using this data please get in touch at opendata@dundeecity.gov.uk or [@opendundee](https://twitter.com/opendundee).
