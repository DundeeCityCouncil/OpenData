## Open Data - Location Datasets

Welcome to our open data repository, as we publish more datasets as open data you should find some resources here including code samples of how to use our services.

For more information and examples of how to use data we have already published please visit the [Wiki ](https://github.com/DundeeCityCouncil/OpenData/wiki).

Because we base some of our data on other organisations datasets we aren't always able to pubilsh information under the Open Government Licence, so please check the licence conditions carefully to check before re-using any information.

If you have any queries please [contact us](mailto:gis@dundeecity.gov.uk).
